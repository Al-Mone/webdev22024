First off, creating an ambitious project is already doomed to a lot of unintended issues, especially because it poses risks of encountering new problems. 
This suggests a prompt to reevaluate the way the project is handled and analyze whether it's still within the feasibility scope. 
Moreover, the compounding unresolved tasks could mean that the team allocated for the project is unfamiliar or inexperienced with the project they're undertaking. 
Finally, despite the meticulous planning that has been done beforehand, it shows that there was a lack of iterative progress, continuous testing, 
and adaptive planning, highlighting the absence of cohesive project management. 
The project would have benefited from an Agile approach, which emphasizes regular sprints, early prototyping, continuous integration, 
and frequent feedback, ensuring that potential issues are addressed promptly and that the project remains on track.
